Yet another unit converter created as part of Scrimba's Frontend Developer Career Path.

It converts between Metric and Imperial (US) for length, volume, and mass based on user input. Its color scheme can be customized with five gradient choices as well as a light/dark mode.

Planned future updates: 
* remember user color and light/dark preference
* responsive
* more robust conversion choices
